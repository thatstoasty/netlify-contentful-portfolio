## its almost that time of year when people want to learn python

As we get closer to the end of one of the oddest years on record and everyone changes their Google search queries to 'best python books 2021', I thought it might be a good time to tackle the incredibly popular question of "If I want to learn Python, what books should I read?".  There are endless articles on the topic - and basically any article will lead you to [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) - but I thought it was time to throw my hat in the ring, so to speak.  If you're not a regular reader, I've done this a few times in the past with [newsletters](/blog/best-data-science-newsletters/), [twitter accounts](/blog/best-data-science-twitter-accounts/), and [podcasts](/blog/best-data-science-podcasts/).

Just as a forewarning, in a few past articles I documented all the code I used to get to the results of the post.  This time I'm not doing so, and I'm sorry.  

I mean I'm not really sorry - it takes *a lot more effort* to format my code from a sketchy jupyter notebook to a presentable-ish jupyter notebook.  So we're just looking at results and random commentary from me this time!

Anyways, on to the stuff you care about - the top python books to read this year.  

## top python books to read in 2021

All the data points here are from Goodreads, which is... probably not the best way to get the data if we're being honest, but its the one I had available to me. So... books!  The list below includes both beginner and not-beginner books - I'll go through the list at another time and split those out, but for now I'm just posting this online.

And what's with the weird sorting, you ask? Well its a combination of average rating & ratings count that I made up for [another project](https://nextnovelproject.com/blog/calculations) that I like a lot.


## So which one should I read if I'm a beginner?

So if we filter down the list above which books are primarily for beginners, you end up with a solid starting point:

- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22514127-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python" target="_blank">Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for Total Beginners</a> by Al Sweigart (4.28 avg, 1,432 ratings)
- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23241059-python-crash-course" target="_blank">Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming</a> by Eric Matthes (4.35 avg, 976 ratings)
- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80435.Learning_Python" target="_blank">Learning Python</a> by Mark Lutz (3.96 avg, 1,976 ratings)
- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22847284-grokking-algorithms-an-illustrated-guide-for-programmers-and-other-curio" target="_blank">Grokking Algorithms An Illustrated Guide For Programmers and Other Curious People</a> by Aditya Y. Bhargava (4.41 avg, 1,576 ratings)
- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14744694-python-for-data-analysis" target="_blank">Python for Data Analysis</a> by Wes McKinney (4.13 avg, 1,226 ratings)

And those are only the top five books on there.  Grokking Algorithms is a bit more focused on the *computer science* aspects of coding rather than the python language, but it does use Python for its examples.  And Python for Data Analysis is basically focused on a python package called *pandas*, which is what any data scientist/analyst spends most of their day in. So if you're truly a beginner, focus on Automate the Boring Stuff, Python Crash Course, and Learning Python.

And definitely keep an eye out for [humble bundles](https://www.humblebundle.com/level-up-your-python) - often you can get ~10 ebooks for $15.
