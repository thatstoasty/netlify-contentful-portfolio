### [next novel project](https://nextnovelproject.com/)

This was a sideproject of mine that I built originally just to help me find a few good books to read. It gets book data from the Goodreads API for any book with over 1000 reviews on the platform, then allows you to search and filter books.  And it has a weekly trending books page!s

The site is built with a combination of [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/), and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/). It runs on top of an [AWS Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/) instance using [Dokku](https://github.com/dokku/dokku).

...and yes, the design of this website is *very* similar to that one... I'm a bit lazy in that regard...
