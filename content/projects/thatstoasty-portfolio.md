### [thatstoasty](https://thatstoasty.netlify.app/)

My first experience working with anything on the front end...and it was used to make this site!
I used Greg on Data and his template repository as a starting point, so most of the credit goes to him.

Its a static website running [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) to take advantage of a few feature (creating/editing posts through the site, contact form management, etc).  As noted in the [about](/about/) page, the site is built with:
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/)
    - [nuxt-content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/)
    - [nuxt-dotenv](https://github.com/nuxt-community/dotenv-module)
    - [vue-moment](https://github.com/brockpetrie/vue-moment)
- [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
    - [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
    - [Netlify Sitemap Plugin](https://github.com/netlify-labs/netlify-plugin-sitemap)
- [illlustrations](https://illlustrations.co/)
