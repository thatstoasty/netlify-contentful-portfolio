This is *not* going to be a complete list, by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm going to update this through the week as I come across deals that I feel should be here.  It's more geared toward python / data science than software engineering.  If there's a lot of interest in front-end deals, I may put something together on that.

Oh, and none of these are affiliate links. Just like... normal links and stuff.  If you're feeling generous, throw me a follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/greg_on_data).

## courses / MOOCs

There are a few specific courses / subscriptions that are on sale this week.

- [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/promo/black-friday-2020) - Annual Subscription 62% off ($149 vs typical price of $399, so ~$12.5/mo). Current month-to-month pricing is $25, for reference.
- [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/subscribe) Annual subscription 50% off ($24.5/mo vs typical $49)
- [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/pricing/skills) - Annual subscriptions are 40% off, coming out to ~$15/mo, $179/yr
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) has a variety of courses that are 'On Sale', but Udemy courses are typically heavily discounted (they'll be offered for $15 vs their list price of $100-200).  That said, these are still on the cheaper end of what you'll see on the site.
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) - It's free! Well, it always is. It's literally in the name, but worth mentioning regardless.
