Hey, you there.  No idea how you found this place, but hopefully you find the site interesting.

Anyways, welcome to this little personal site. Its some combination of a blog and a collection of some random personal projects I've done in the past year or so.  Oddly enough, my job is completely unrelated to web development & design; web development has just ended up as one of my hobbies...

The blog aspect here will mainly be focused on data science / data engineering / data visualization / me complaining about those topics. But every once in a while I'll talk about other random stuff... Probably. Honestly I have no idea how this is going to go...

For some odd reason, I've always wanted to have a clean, personal site to just host a few posts and some other random stuff.  And while its rather easy to start a personal blog on Blogger/Wordpress or Squarespace, I thought the blogging platforms looked ugly and I'm too cheap to pay for a Squarespace account... So here we are. With me building a blog from scratch...

If anyone's curious about how this site was built, the project repo is [here](https://github.com/gms64/greg_on_data):
